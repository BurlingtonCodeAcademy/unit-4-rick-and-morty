# Rick and Morty DOM & Fetch Practice

## Intro

This lesson will allow you to practice your Fetch utilization and DOM manipulation.

Rick and Morty is an American science show. This API is rich in information about the show. The API is able to field request to many `id's` through its query params.

## Instructions

The instructions will be vague for a reason. After all, you can accomplish this task many different ways.

- Utilize existing files and code to fetch data from the API for two Rick and Morty characters. 
- Once you can visualize the data in your console, use the existing `render` function to display pictures of the two characters.
- To do this, it will require retrieving elements from the `HTML` file and modifying some of their properties.
- After the successful retrieval and rendering, ensure that each picture is centered, has a border radius, and a border color of your choice.

## Going Further
- Access the character's name and display it above the pictures
- Give a user the ability to choose the character id through the use of an input.
- Try and handle all the errors you may encounter
